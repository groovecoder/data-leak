# data-leak

![Screenshot](screenshot.png "Screenshot")

A [Browser Extension](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions)
to help detect potentially unsafe data leaving the browser. Including ...

- A webRequest listener version of [CLIQZ code](https://github.com/cliqz-oss/browser-core/blob/master/modules/antitracking/sources/attrack.es) for detecting potentially unsafe data leaving the browser.
- A content script version of [OpenWPM](https://github.com/citp/OpenWPM) and [Privacy Badger](https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadger) code for detecting which APIs are being used ... for fingerprinting.
- A browserAction for displaying all of the above.

This extension simply detects and logs network and API data - it does not store
anything in a database. If you need all that good stuff, you should really look
into OpenWPM - it's good people.

## Run it

You should really use the [`web-ext`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-ext)
tool - it's great. After you've installed it globally ...

```
cd data-leak
web-ext run
```

In the Firefox browser that opens:

1. Open the Web Console tool
2. Navigate to any page
3. Observe the "Successfully started all instrumentation." line

You should also see lots of output in the format: `type: logCall ; msg:
<Object> ; msg.value: `
